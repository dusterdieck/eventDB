As a person looking for an event, I'd like to be able to see what is available to do, what's within how far I'm willing to travel, and how much it's gonna cost me.


Results:
	We have a geolocating map that hungry, bored users who search dining and entertainment options through keywords or default results. 

Team Efforts:
	Kelly: Google Map API Integration. 
	Tim: Eventful API Integration. 
	Patrick: Zomato API intergation and AJAX calls 
	Michael: Materialize / Interface.
	Tim and Patrick: Worked on Firebas Integration



Challenges: 
	Kelly: Learning Git and about the Google API.
	Tim: Finding the info needed to do the Eventful API call. 
	Patrick: QA Testing. Makin it all wurk! 
	Michael: Struggling with UI Kit. Finding the proper CDNs to integrate. Learning about how to use a very opinionated Materialize. 
	Team: Understanding different coding styles of others. Git.  

Improvements:
	- Mapping routes between chosen events. 
	- Saving Events in Firebase. 
	- Make it prettier. 
	- Mobile Integration. 
	- Inputting the hours that the restaurants are 
	open and events happen so that the user doesn't plan to do something when it's unavailable.
